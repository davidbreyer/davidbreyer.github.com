Geotagging is the process of adding geographical metadata to various media, 
such as photos. I use an iPhone app called [Geotag Photos Pro](http://www.geotagphotos.net)
to record GPS data that will later be added to photos taken from my DSLR. It records the GPS,
time, and date at a specified interval. Later you can use software on your computer to match
the approximate time and date to a GPS location. That GPS location will be added to the metadata
of the photo.

On a previous trip from New York City to Cincinnati, by way of Amtrak's Cardinal, I decided to
geotag the entire ride. Every two minutes the application recorded the GPS location of
the train. At the conclusion of the trip, I exported the GPS data as a GPX file. Using a site called
[GPS Visualizer](http://www.gpsvisualizer.com) I was able to add the GPS data to Google maps.

For even more detail I added this trip to [Everytrail.com](http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=2690362). 
Which allows you to share trips and view stats, such as average speed.

I plan to use this on my upcoming cycling trip from Prague to Vienna.
